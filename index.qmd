Welcome!

We are a new group at the [Biodiversity Research Center, Academia Sinica](https://www.biodiv.tw/) in Taipei, Taiwan. The lab officially launches in <u>November 2025</u>, and we welcome applications at all levels. We currently have vacancies for graduate students, research assistants and a postdoc. [Join Us](join.qmd)!

Our research sits at the interface of evolutionary ecology and systems biology. We study host-associated microbial communities— complex systems layered by hosts, symbionts, and mobile genes— with the goal of uncovering the rules and mechanisms that govern them. By integrating fieldwork, laboratory experiments, and theoretical models, we ask when and how diversity across multiple levels of organization emerges, persists, or collapses.
