> **Is biological diversity an inevitable outcome of deterministic selection, or the contingent result of historical chance?**

Biology contains multitudes: ecological and evolutionary dynamics play out across multiple levels of organization — from host communities to symbiont consortia to mobile genetic elements.  

**Evolution** is the study of history — how past mutations, rare events, and chance perturbations leave lasting imprints.  
**Ecology** is the study of interdependence — how organisms interact with one another and their environments, shaping the diversity we see today.  

Together, they frame a central question that drives our lab:  




We aim to understand **symbiosis in an ecological and evolutionary context across biological scales**. We ask how deterministic forces (selection) and historical contingencies (mutations, rare events, environmental perturbations) interact to shape diversity.

## Theme I — Diversity at the level of host communities

**Question:** What drives the diversity in symbiosis at the level of host communities?  
- **Determinism (host selection):** symbiont communities differ across co-occurring hosts.  
- **Contingency (spatial proximity):** symbiont communities differ across sampling sites and natural gradients (urbanization, elevation).  

**Approaches:**  
- Field transect sampling  
- Metagenomics  
- De novo genome assembly  
- Phylogenomics

## Theme II — Diversity at the level of symbiont communities

**Question:** What drives the diversity in symbiosis at the level of symbiont communities?  
- **Determinism (competition):** symbiont communities are highly repeatable across host replicates.  
- **Contingency (neutrality):** symbiont communities differ across replicate hosts.  

**Approaches:**  
- Symbiont community enrichment experiments  
- Synthetic community construction  
- Metagenomics  
- Mathematical modeling

## Theme III — Diversity at the level of symbiosis islands

**Question:** What drives the diversity in symbiosis at the level of mobile symbiosis islands?  
- **Determinism (selection at gene/genome level):** gene sweeps or genome sweeps across symbiont communities.  
- **Contingency (horizontal gene transfer):** fixation of symbiosis islands depends on idiosyncratic HGT events.  

**Approaches:**  
- Synthetic community experiments  
- Molecular genetics  
- Gene editing and tagging  
- Computer vision assays
