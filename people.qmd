**Chang-Yu Chang 張昌祐**

*Principal Investigator*

Chang-Yu (he/him) is fascinated by the system-level properties that emerge across different levels of biological organization, particularly as the result of species interactions and evolutionary forces. As an evolutionary ecologist and systems biologist, he enjoys collaborating with field ecologists, theoreticians, and bioengineers. Chang-Yu received his PhD in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Yale University, where he studied the emergent properties of microbial consortia with [Álvaro Sánchez](https://sanchezlaboratory.weebly.com/). He then joined the University of Pennsylvania as a postdoctoral fellow, investigating the evolution of plant–microbe symbiosis with [Corlett Wood](https://www.the-wood-lab.com/), before joining the Biodiversity Research Center, Academia Sinica. 

Outside of science, Chang-Yu is an avid craft beer enthusiast. He’s always happy to chat about microbes and fermentation. You can find his latest drinking notes on [Untappd](https://untappd.com/user/changyu).

*Wellness Manager*  &nbsp; | &nbsp; *Purrs-doctoral Researcher*

Luna (she/her) is a dedicated scholar of cuteness, with her primary subject being herself. She embodies the charming narcissism of a true feline.
