Chang-Yu (he/him) began his fascination with biology as an undergraduate and later earned a master’s degree in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at National Taiwan University, where he studied beetle behavior. He then moved to the US for a PhD in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Yale University, where he investigated microbial community assembly and developed quantitative approaches to predict and engineer the emergent properties of microbial consortia. As a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Biology at the University of Pennsylvania, he turned his focus to the evolution of host–symbiont systems. After several years on the East Coast, he returned to Taiwan in 2025 to join the Biodiversity Research Center at Academia Sinica as an Assistant Research Fellow.

**Luna**  
*Purrs-doctoral Researcher*  

Luna (she/her) is a scholar of cuteness, with her primary subject being herself. She embodies the charming narcissism of a true feline.
