    "text": "Chang-Yu Chang 張昌祐\nPrincipal Investigator\nChang-Yu (he/him) is fascinated by the system-level properties that emerge across different levels of biological organization, particularly as the result of species interactions and evolutionary forces. As an evolutionary ecologist, he enjoys collaborating with field ecologists, theoreticians, and systems biologists. Chang-Yu received his PhD in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Yale University, where he studied the emergent properties of microbial consortia with Álvaro Sánchez. He then joined the University of Pennsylvania as a postdoctoral fellow, investigating the evolution of plant–microbe symbiosis with Corlett Wood, before joining the Biodiversity Research Center, Academia Sinica.\nOutside of science, Chang-Yu is an avid craft beer enthusiast. He’s always happy to chat about microbes and fermentation. You can find his latest drinking notes on Untappd.\nEmail: changyuchang@gate.sinica.edu.tw\nCV · GitHub · Google Scholar · BlueSky\n\n\n\nTzu-Hsin Ku 顧子欣\nBIODIV TIGP Graduate Student\nTzu-Hsin (he/him) is fascinated by the diverse and essential roles of microbiota in sustaining environmental balance. His graduate research on the bacterial microbiome in food deepened his curiosity to this field. Although his thesis focused on characterizing bacteria from food samples, he also pursued additional training in yeast epigenetics to strengthen his molecular understanding of biological questions. Beyond the world of microbes and molecules, Tzu-Hsin is a beginner marathon participant. He is happy to go jogging together, as long as you can wait for him for a minute.\n\n\n\nLuna 嚕哪\nWellness Manager   |   Purrs-doctoral Researcher\nLuna (she/her) is a dedicated scholar of cuteness, with her primary subject being herself. She embodies the charming narcissism of a true feline. Originally from the streets of Philadelphia, she discovered the joy of indoor life before traveling thousands of miles to settle on the rain-soaked island of Taiwan. Luna mostly works from home; so nope, you won’t see her in the lab."

    "text": "Welcome!\nWe are a new group at the Biodiversity Research Center, Academia Sinica in Taipei, Taiwan. The lab officially launches in November 2025, and we welcome applications at all levels. We currently have vacancies for graduate students, research assistants and a postdoc. Join Us!\nOur research sits at the interface of evolutionary ecology and systems biology. We study host-associated microbial communities— complex systems layered by hosts, symbionts, and mobile genes— with the goal of uncovering the rules and mechanisms that govern them. By integrating fieldwork, laboratory experiments, and theoretical models, we ask when and how diversity across multiple levels of organization emerges, persists, or collapses."

    "text": "Evolution of Host–Microbe Symbiosis\n\n How does the free-living stage shape the evolution of facultative symbionts that regularly associate with hosts?\n Adaptation during the free-living stage leaves distinct biogeographic and genomic signatures in facultative symbiotic microbes associated with a widely distributed host.\n Population genomics, growth assays, phylogenetic comparative methods.\n Facultative symbiosis, mutualism, rhizobia.\n Chang et al. 2025\nFacultative symbionts alternate between host-associated and free-living stages. We study how environmental adaptation outside the host drives genomic divergence and population structure, providing new insights into the evolution of microbial symbiosis.\n\n\nEmergent Coexistence & Community Assembly\n\n Why do diverse microbial consortia coexist, and can such coexistence be explained by simple pairwise priniciples?\n Coexistence arises as an emergent property of microbial communities— systems that remain stable even when their constituent pairs cannot.\n Synthetic communities, competitive assays, machine-learning–based image analysis.\n Community ecology, microbial ecology, complex system.\n Chang et al. 2023\nWe combine experiments and theory to explore how stability emerges from complex microbial interactions. Our results reveal that coexistence is not reducible to pairwise outcomes but is an emergent, collective feature of multispecies communities.\n\n\nMicrobiome Engineering & Artificial Selection\n\n How can microbial communities be evolved or engineered as functional units through artificial selection?\n Community-level functions can improve across selection cycles when heritable variation is maintained or replenished.\n Experimental evolution, metabolic assays, computational modeling.\n Microbiome engineering, artificial selection, directed evolution.\n Chang et al. 2020 · Chang et al. 2021\nWe treat microbial consortia as evolving entities, subject to artificial selection on desired community traits. By combining experimental evolution and modeling, we develop frameworks for optimizing microbiome function and stability."
