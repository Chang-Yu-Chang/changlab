We study host-associated microbial communities— complex systems layered by hosts, symbionts, and mobile genes—with the goal of uncovering the simple rules that govern them. By integrating fieldwork, laboratory experiments, and theoretical models, we ask when and how diversity across multiple levels of organization emerges, persists, or collapses."
