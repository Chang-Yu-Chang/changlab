In synthetic communities, your work demonstrated that stable coexistence can arise even when pairs fail to coexist, underscoring that higher-order (3+ species) interactions are key to community stability. :contentReferenceoaicite:1\nDirected evolution of communities works—if you manage heritability and variation. Across hundreds of evolving communities, selection improved function until between-community heritable variation was exhausted; theory then identified two design principles to keep improving: stabilize communities (raise heritability) and perturb ecologies (inject variation). :contentReferenceoaicite:2\nFacultative symbionts diverge via interacting adaptive and non-adaptive processes. Using common-garden experiments and de novo genomes of Sinorhizobium, ongoing work reveals context-dependent divergence tied to host genotype, geography, and nutrients—illustrating how free-living and host-associated phases shape evolution. :contentReferenceoaicite:3"
