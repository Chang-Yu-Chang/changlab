    "text": "Chang-Yu Chang 張昌祐\nPrincipal Investigator\nChang-Yu (he/him) is fascinated by the system-level properties that emerge across different levels of biological organization, particularly as the result of species interactions and evolutionary forces. As an evolutionary ecologist and systems biologist, he enjoys collaborating with field ecologists, theoreticians, and bioengineers. Chang-Yu received his PhD in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Yale University, where he studied the emergent properties of microbial consortia with Álvaro Sánchez. He then joined the University of Pennsylvania as a postdoctoral fellow, investigating the evolution of plant–microbe symbiosis with Corlett Wood, before joining the Biodiversity Research Center, Academia Sinica.\nOutside of science, Chang-Yu is an avid craft beer enthusiast. He’s always happy to chat about microbes and fermentation. You can find his latest drinking notes on Untappd.\nEmail: changlabbrc@gmail.com\nCV · GitHub · Google Scholar · BlueSky\n\n\n\nLuna 嚕哪\nWellness Manager   |   Purrs-doctoral Researcher\nLuna (she/her) is a dedicated scholar of cuteness, with her primary subject being herself. She embodies the charming narcissism of a true feline. Originally from the streets of Philadelphia, she discovered the joy of indoor life before traveling thousands of miles to settle on the rain-soaked island of Taiwan."

    "text": "Welcome!\nWe are a new group at the Biodiversity Research Center, Academia Sinica in Taipei, Taiwan. The lab officially launches in November 2025, and we welcome applications at all levels. The official job ads will be announced soon in Join Us!\nOur research sits at the interface of ecology, evolution, and systems biology. We study host-associated microbial communities— complex systems layered by hosts, symbionts, and mobile genes—with the goal of uncovering the simple rules that govern them. By integrating fieldwork, laboratory experiments, and theoretical models, we ask when and how diversity across multiple levels of organization emerges, persists, or collapses."

    "text": "Evolution of Host–Microbe Symbiosis\n\nFacultative symbionts live dual lives: free-living and host-associated. It’s therefore puzzling how and why these microbial symbionts maintain genomic integrity in the everchanging environments over evolutionary time. Using population genomics and laboratory assays, we study how these multitudes of life stages shape the genetic diversity and divergence in microbial symbionts. Our work on host–symbiont systems explores how microbial symbionts adapt across hosts and environments (Chang et al 2025).\n\n\nEmergent Coexistence & Community Assembly\n\nOne fundamental school of thoughts in ecology is the notion of interacting species pairs and its relation to coexistence and ecosystem functioning. However, the absurdly diverse ecosystems in nature challenge this pairwise, “bottom-up” perspective. Alternatively, mechanisms beyond pairwise must be involved. We experimentally showed that microbial communities can stably coexist despite that pairs of constituent species failed to do so (Chang et al 2023). This result unequivocally lended the support for the view that species coexistence is an emergent property of ecological communities.\n\n\nMicrobiome Engineering & Artificial Selection\n\nMicrobial communities can be treated as evolving units, subject to artificial selection. As a proof of principle in experimental evolution systems, we found that community function can be improved by selection until heritable variation is exhausted (Chang et al 2020). A further computational study identified key strategies, which invoke stabilizing communities and perturbing ecological states, that extend this improvement by replenishing the heritable variation (Chang et al 2021). These insights point toward a design framework for microbiome engineering, where any communities can be optimized for desired traits."
