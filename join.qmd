We welcome applications from motivated students, postdocs, and research staff who are excited about **microbial symbiosis, ecology, and evolution**. Our group values every member of the team and strives to foster a **collaborative, inclusive, and curiosity-driven** environment where teamwork and creativity drive discovery.  

Our research spans **community ecology**, **microbial ecology**, and **evolutionary genomics**, drawing inspiration from **ecological and evolutionary theory**, **quantitative genetics**, and **systems biology**. In practice, our work often combines multiple approaches:

![](images/icons/mac-option-key.svg){.icon} **Computations:** population genomics, simulations, phylogenetic comparative methods  

![](images/icons/flask.svg){.icon}  **Laboratory experiments:** plant cultivation, microbiological cultures, metabolic assays

![](images/icons/soil-alt.svg){.icon}  **Field work:** transect and population sampling

While no specific wet- or dry-lab background is required, trainees in the lab are encouraged to develop a versatile skill set that spans both experimental and computational methods.  

If you are interested in joining, please contact **Dr. Chang-Yu Chang** at [changlabbrc@gmail.com](mailto:changlabbrc@gmail.com) with your **CV**, a short **summary of research experience**, and a brief **statement of interests**.
