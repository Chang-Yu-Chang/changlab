# Join the Lab


We welcome motivated students and researchers who are excited about **microbial ecology, evolution, and symbiosis**, and who value a collaborative and inclusive environment.  

Our research explores how microbial symbionts assemble, diversify, and function across environments, with a focus on the balance between **determinism and contingency** in community assembly and the role of **mobile genetic elements** in host–microbe interactions.

## Research Themes

- Population structure and genomic diversity of facultative symbionts  
- Repeatability vs. contingency in host adaptation  
- Interactions among mutualists, parasites, and hosts  
- Ecological and evolutionary rules of microbial community assembly  

## Research Tools

- Comparative genomics (long- and short-read sequencing, pangenomes, synteny)  
- Experimental evolution  
- Common garden and field experiments  
- Phylogenetic and statistical modeling  
- Ecological theory
